# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
This project is performed to detect fraud in credit card transactions, using supervised learning methods such as Logistic Regression, KNN, SVC and Decision Tree.

The dataset collects transactions over two days, in which 492 frauds were recorded out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is notably unbalanced, as the positive class (frauds) constitutes only 0.172% of all transactions. Furthermore, the set contains numerical input variables resulting from a PCA transformation where the features V1, V2, and V28 correspond to the principal components. In contrast, the only features that were not transformed are 'Time' and 'Amount.' The variable 'Time' represents the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first one recorded in the dataset, while the variable 'Amount' indicates the transaction amount. Finally, the variable 'Class' is the response, taking the value 1 in case of fraud and 0 otherwise. The dataset can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud
